# Vertical console holder for Ender-3 V3 SE 3D-printer

The holder that comes with the printer is used to hang the console on the side - but in this configuration it doesn't fit on a narrow shelf.

So, I've designed a holder that places it vertically.

Use dense infill, as the model has a top horizontal surface.
